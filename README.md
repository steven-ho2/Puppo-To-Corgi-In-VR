This project is a weekend project of mine. It is based off of the Puppo the Corgi demo projects for Unity's ML Agent. I ported the demo over to Virtual Reality.

I am providing the project free to anyone that wants it. I found that it was fun to play fetch in VR, so I'm sharing the fun.

For this game you'll need SteamVR and a Windows PC that meets the minimum Specs for VR. I'm sure that it will work with Vive and Oculus. I developed the port on my Window's Mixed Reality Headset using the SteamVR Plugin.

How to install and play:
1. Download all three of the puppoinvr files
2. Extract them to desired location.
2. Go into the folder and run the Puppos the corgi in vr executable
